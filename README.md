# nodejs-ts-express-e-commerce

This is stock and client management application for an e-commerce, based on a pretty basic data model.

## Objective

The goal of this project was to get back on track with backend development. For this project, the focus wasn't on the data model and its complexity, but rather on its technologies and functionalities. The idea for this project is to maintain the data model and its functionalities as a sort of "application template" and iterate on them as I add new technologies to my stack.

- Typescript
